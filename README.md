## About Proteus
[Proteus](http://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus) is a collection of useful
starter kits to help you prototype faster. It follows the
[thoughtbot styleguide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides) and includes our
favorite front end tools.

About Middleman
---------------
Middleman is a static site generator built in Ruby. This makes it a great fit
for projects that may end up as a Ruby on Rails app. Its minimalistic structure
makes it very easy to work with, and includes support for deploying to Github
Pages.

  Simple template markup
* [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org):
